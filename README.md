# Benchmarking Jordanian Coral-Reef Fish Biodiversity with Reef Physical Properties and Biotic Factors
Capstone project for 2016 Summer Ecosystem Experience for Undergraduates (SEE-U) in Jordan

Content:
 - Cross-validated Ridge and lasso regression models that effectively predict (absolute percentage error < 25%) indicators of coral-reef-fish biodiversity using data from Wagner et al. (https://peerj.com/articles/1459/)
 - Tested the models on my own field-collected data 
 - Visualized model performance under different strengths of different regularization terms

Directed by 
 - Professor Jenna Mara Lawrence of Columbia University and
 - Doctor Suzanne Macey of American Museum of Natural History
